## Introduction

To make progress in breeding, populations should have a favorable mean
and high genetic variance (Bernardo 2010). These two parameters can be
combined into a single measure called the usefulness criterion (Schnell
and Utz 1975), visualized in Figure 1.

![Figure 1. Visualization of the mean, genetic variance, and superior progeny mean of a single population.](vignettes/figures/figure1.png)

Ideally, breeders would identify the set of parent combinations that,
when realized in a cross, would give rise to populations meeting these
requirements. `PopVar` is a package that uses phenotypic and genomewide
marker data on a set of candidate parents to predict the mean, genetic
variance, and superior progeny mean in bi-parental or multi-parental
populations. Thre package also contains functionality for performing
cross-validation to determine the suitability of different statistical
models. More details are available in Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015)
A dataset `think_barley` is included for reference and examples.

## Installation

You can install the released version of PopVar from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PopVar")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UMN-BarleyOatSilphium/PopVar")
```


## What's new

In version 2.0, we added the following functionalities:

* ✅ Simpler functions for reading in and filtering genotypic and phenotypic data.  
* ✅ Support for outcrossing populations with heterozygous parents using phased marker genotypes



## Examples

Examples are outlined in the package vignette.
